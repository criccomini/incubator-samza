/**
 * After the input SystemStreamPartitions have been mapped to their TaskNames by an implementation of
 * {@link org.apache.samza.container.grouper.stream.SystemStreamPartitionGrouper}, we can then map those groupings onto
 * the {@link org.apache.samza.container.SamzaContainer}s on which they will run.  This class takes
 * those groupings-of-SSPs and groups them together on which container each should run on.  A simple
 * implementation could assign each TaskNamesToSystemStreamPartition to a separate container.  More
 * advanced implementations could examine the TaskNamesToSystemStreamPartition to group by them
 * by data locality, anti-affinity, even distribution of expected bandwidth consumption, etc.
